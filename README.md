# AIPI590PhysicalMidterm

## Background/introduction of the idea
This project is a car device built for save driving. It has 2 modes: driving mode and reversing mode. When in driving mode, the device will collect the acceleration and gyroscope reading and give the warning when driving unsafely. In reversing mode, the distance sensor will measure the distance and give warning via LED light when close to an obstacle. The mode switch is done by a button.
